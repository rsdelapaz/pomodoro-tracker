Here's the improved English translation with detailed feedback on the Pomodoro application issues:

"We still have several critical issues to address in our Pomodoro application:

* The color theme switcher remains non-functional - please investigate JavaScript event handlers for the theme selection controls and ensure the appropriate CSS classes are being applied when a theme is selected. Check the console for errors that might indicate why theme changes aren't being rendered.

* The show/hide options toggle continues to malfunction - implement a persistent floating action button that remains accessible regardless of interface state. This button should use localStorage to track visibility preferences and ensure users can always access controls.

* The tab design needs significant improvement - remove the current underline indicator and implement a more intuitive three-dimensional design that mimics physical buttons:
  - Create a subtle container with light border or shadow for all three tab options
  - Apply a gentle gradient or shadow to create depth
  - Make the selected option appear visually depressed/inset with darker background and possibly a subtle inset shadow
  - Unselected tabs should appear slightly raised with a lighter background
  - Maintain appropriate contrast ratios between text and backgrounds regardless of selection state

* Consider adding subtle hover states to improve interaction feedback without disrupting the minimalist aesthetic

* The circular timer could benefit from a faint pulse animation during active countdown to provide subtle visual feedback of progression

* Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate aria attributes for accessibility while maintaining our clean visual design

This revised approach should provide clearer visual hierarchy while maintaining our minimalist design principles. The goal is to create intuitive affordances that users instinctively understand without requiring excessive visual weight or explanation.

Can you please address these issues with priority on fixing the functional problems with theme switching and option visibility controls?"
